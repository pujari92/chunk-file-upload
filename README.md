PHP Chunk File Upload using JavaScript

Today we are going to learn PHP Chunk File Upload using JavaScript. The Chunked Upload provides a way to reliably upload large files to Box by chunking them into a sequence of parts that can be uploaded individually. By using this the application uploads a file in part, allowing it to recover from a failed request more reliably.
